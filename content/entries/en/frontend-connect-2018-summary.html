  <title>Front-end Connect 2018: Summary</title>
  <banner src="frontend-connect-2018-ceiling.jpg" />
  <brief>
    <p>In December of 2018, there was second edition of <a href="https://frontend-con.io" target="_blank">Front-end Connect</a> conference in Warsaw. I was present at first edition of this conference in 2017, and <a href="https://soofka.pl/entry/front-end-connect-2017-summary" target="_blank">wrote down my impression in blog post over a year ago</a>. TL;DR: I felt it was quite OK event, with plenty of things well thought and prepared, but also a lot of room for improvements. I was happy to see that many improvements were introduced, and the conference provided better experience when it comes to organization, but also level and quality of the talks. Here are my few thoughts to sum it up.</p>
  </brief>
  <content>
    <p>Main changes compared to last year was time and place of the conference. While moving from September to December didn't matter too much for me, moving from Warsaw Expo to Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw was major upgrade. The place is much more accessible, especially given last year's road works everywhere around Expo, and the venue is just much better. It's more spacious than the previous one, which resulted in less issues with catering, cloakroom, toilets etc., and it had lecture rooms prepared properly, so there was no sound overlapping between two speakers giving two different talks. Last, but not least, it's old and beautiful building, full of history, which gave the conference cool, unusual vibe.</p>
    <p>I was also surprised by quality of the talks. Last year I was a little bit disappointed in this aspect - the most important one in IT conference, if you ask me. I guess that I expected to hear there a lot of cool stuff that I have never heard of before, and it wasn't the case at all. This year, my expectations were significantly more down to earth, but the conference was also greatly upgraded in that matter, and I was legitimately hyped for new, cool stuff, when it ended. Here are some of the best talks I have attended during Front-end Connect 2018.</p>
    <h3>AI + JavaScript Rocks - Asim Hussain</h3>

    <p>Honestly, this talk was the most fun for me during Front-end Connect 2018. I was blown away by capabilities of AI programmed in JS, especially by examples shown during the talk, such as <a href="https://drawingbot.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">DrawingBot</a>, which generates images of birds based on ones description, or <a href="https://themojifier.com/" target="_blank">The Mojifier</a>, which recognizes facial expressions on ones photo and replaces them with emojis, which are supposed to match emotions displayed. Much more examples of cool ways to utilize this technology can be found on <a href="https://aijs.rocks" target="_blank">AIJS.rocks</a> website.</p>
    <p>Speaker for this talk, Asim Hussain, who works in Microsoft as a developer on a daily basis, showcased not only stellar public speaking skills and a bunch of hypey online apps, but also provided great, yet brief explanation on how neural networks under the hood of those apps work, and how one can harness their power with currently the most popular JS framework for this purpose, TensorFlow. Talk highly recommended.</p>
    <h3>Getting your Team Passionate About Web Performance to Achieve Performant Web Apps - Nicolas Goutay</h3>
    <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/phacks" target="_blank">@phacks</a>, <a href="https://noti.st/phacks/FurUmG/getting-your-team-passionate-about-web-performance-to-achieve-performant-web-apps" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
    <youtube-video><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m3XL0LVJaUo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></youtube-video>
    <p>This talk combined hints for better front-end performance with hints for getting teams committed to stuff, both of which I find interesting, given that's basically what I'm doing in my organization (plus a lot of other things). My best takeaway from this lecture was list of helpful ideas and tools for establishing and maintaining performance in living software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IDE plugins measuring and displaying cost of imports on the fly</li>
      <li>plugin for dependency management system to find and exclude duplicates</li>
      <li>plugin for VCS to set size thresholds for pull requests</li>
      <li><a href="https://bundlephobia.com" target="_blank">bundlephobia.com</a> - online tool to find the cost of adding a npm package to your bundle</li>
      <li><a href="https://web.dev" target="_blank">web.dev</a> - platform to measure performance of a website and learn how to improve it</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Accessible Charts Done Right - Sergei Kriger</h3>
    <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/_sergeikriger" target="_blank">@_sergeikriger</a>, <a href="https://www.sergeikriger.com/accessible-charts-done-right/" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
    <youtube-video><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ko3ZaZcVTkc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></youtube-video>
    <p>Accessibility is big topic for me lately. With this talk, again I got surprised by another, common piece of the web (and UIs in general), that I have never considered in terms of accessibility - graphs. This talk showed my how much depth there is to making graphs accessible.</p>
    <p>When you think about it, how would you make graph convenient to read for someone with impaired vision? During the talk, Based on multiple examples, Sergei proposed plenty of solutions, from separate description per bar in chart, to providing all the data as full table, or even CSV file, in case of extremely complicated or verbose set of data. Every case was interesting to consider.</p>
    <h3>Why we’ll all use React Hooks - Marcin Hagmajer</h3>
    <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/mhagmajer" target="_blank">@mhagmajer</a></h5>
    <youtube-video><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HV3iN4vDLRo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></youtube-video>
    <p>I've seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLF0n9SACd4" target="_blank">Dan Abramov's talk about React Hooks from last years JSConf Iceland</a>, and it was pretty much all one needed to know about this new API. Still, I've found Marcin's talk about it interesting. Information was well structured and presented, and helped me solidify my understanding of React Hooks. Cool!</p>
    <h3>Cross browser extensions – lets make one - Trishul Goel</h3>
    <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/trishulgoel" target="_blank">@trishulgoel</a>, <a href="http://slides.com/trishulgoel/extensions-frontendconnect#/" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
    <youtube-video><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WT5ESQiokYU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></youtube-video>
    <p>I was pondering around with a few ideas for browser extensions for a few weeks in last year, so I got a little bit of know how on the subject. Despite that I've found Trishul's talk very interesting, especially tips and tricks for development, and all different APIs that are available to extensions nowadays (such as Notifications API or even DevTools API!). There was also introduced, although not well explored, an idea of <a href="https://webextensions.tech/">WebExtensions</a>, which is a way to write extensions, that makes them cross-browser. Worth investigating!</p>
    <h3>Sweet Web Animations API - Rodolfo Dias</h3>
    <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/r_mdias" target="_blank">@r_mdias</a>, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rmdias/sweet-web-animations-api" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
    <youtube-video><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pJGhGEsgtto" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></youtube-video>
    <p>Oh boy, did I like this talk. It was funny and goofy, and I enjoyed it to the maximum. Rodolfo showed us his cool, SVG dog, which he animated with Web Animations API. I've played a little bit with the API since then and it's wonderful for making regular web animations easily programmable.</p>
    <p>What I've found much more interesting in this talk, though, was <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API">Web Speech API</a> - basically fully capable voice-to-text API, available in browser. It's still in early development, but I am already creating my own robot-in-browser companion.</p>
    <h3>The missing piece of testing - Maciej Myśliński</h3>
    <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/maciejmyslinski" target="_blank">@maciejmyslinski</a></h5>
    <youtube-video><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSB_JWfBcUU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></youtube-video>
    <p>Honestly, I had this thought in my mind for some time before this conference: isn't it wrong that we're writing unit tests based on our own, arbitrarily selected examples? You can't find bugs you don't know about, right?</p>
    <p>Turns out, not only I had this thought in the back of my had. Marcin, for one, had a talk about it. In his talk, he proposes to change our approach, and write property based tests - tests, in which you define general properties of input parameters of your functions, and machine comes up with random examples on its own. As an idea, in its core, it's not that ground breaking, really. What was new to me was that it can be done, easily.</p>
    <p>Marcin showed me, that there are JS libraries for that purpose, one of which being <a href="https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check">fast-check</a> (since then I've tried a few others and I find this one having the most convenient learning curve). It enables one to write quite simple, human readable definitions of properties for his tests. It also comes with this cool feature of shrinking - values, for which your test did not pass, are progressively simplified in order to provide you with the simplest possible scenario for you to reproduce.</p>
    <p>Of course, this approach is not to be taken religiously, it's not meant for every single one of your functions. I will dwell on this topic in a separate blog post.</p>
    <h3>Garbage collection in modern web applications - Jan Monschke</h3>
    <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/thedeftone" target="_blank">@thedeftone</a></h5>
    <youtube-video><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtDELTziIUo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></youtube-video>
    <p>I was interested in this talk, because I wanted to learn about the guts of JavaScript. Didn't learn that much, since Jan didn't want to bore his audience with the details, but still got inspired to dig it up on my own. As a result, I've found <a href="https://blog.sessionstack.com/@zlatkov" target="_blank">wonderful blog of Alexander Zlatkov</a>, where he publishes his series "How JavaScript works", which explains everything I ever wanted to know, and much, much more, in scientific particulars. Awesome.</p>
    <p>From the talk itself, I took two things for myself: 1. there is actual JavaScript band, it's called Nested Loops; 2. garbage collection might be a huge issue for apps like SoundCloud, which is often open in user's browser literally for days, playing music non stop. He knows it, because he encountered this exact issue in SoundCloud. They solved it by implementing their own kind of garbage collection for Redux. Whole case is extremely interesting from developer's point of view, and it's also real world example, which makes it double as fun to reason about.</p>
    <h3>Use Angular for better React apps - Martin Hochel</h3>
    <h5><a href="https://twitter.com/martin_hotell" target="_blank">@martin_hotell</a>, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/martin_hotell/use-angular-for-better-react-apps" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
    <youtube-video><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W-iF_mVWhvs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></youtube-video>
    <p>Last but not least, Martin Hochel, who I remember from Front-end Connect 2017, and who is an author of <a href="https://medium.com/@martin_hotell" target="_blank">popular blog</a> among React and TypeScript users. Similarly to previous year, he came to tell us about cool new ideas he had, that might solve some of more common problems front-end developers have nowadays, and then to tell us that he solved them already himself with this and that cool new library.</p>
    <p>This year, his talk was about features of Angular, that he's missing in React, mainly dependency injection, stateful services, and routing. Being an Angular newbie, I was interested in solutions to common problems, that this framework provide. Martin went a few steps further, and basically moved them to React with his two new libraries, <a href="https://github.com/Hotell/rea-di" target="_blank">rea-di</a> (which provides dependency injection and stateful services) and rr-ear (which handles routing, and was only announced during the talk, not released yet as of time of writing this entry).</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>And that's all what was in Front-end Connect 2018 for me, based on my memory and notes, over one month after the conference. I must admit, I am satisfied with the outcome for me - I learned a lot, I got inspired a lot, and I met and hanged out with a lot of cool people. Thank you all who read this, and all who I've talked with during Front-end Connect 2018. Most likely, see you next year!</p>
