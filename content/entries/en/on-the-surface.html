  <brief>
    <p>I am web developer. My job is to solve problems, usually related to software architecture or specific details of software implementation. During that process, I often find myself browsing the Internet, looking for people who had similar problems, solved them and described their solution. This kind of content is generally found either on internet forums or professional blogs. Since these sources provided me with, often very comprehensive, answers on countless occasions, I thought that the best way to appreciate their effort to share their knowledge would be to contribute to this knowledge base myself.</p>

  <content>
    <p>Hi! I am Jakub Sowi≈Ñski. I started writing down solutions to some of the problems that I confront during both my professional and private web development. These notes will be presented here in form of blog posts. I expect them to be major, if not the only category of content.</p>
    <p>I have wide range of web development experience, from databases, through back-end, to front-end. In my current position I am full-stack web developer, but lately almost all of my tasks are focused on front-end, so I suppose that most of my posts for the next few months at least will be related to JavaScript, TypeScript and React. Sooner or later more variety of subjects will come.</p>
    <p>Some code from my blog posts will be also available on GitHub. Whenever I will refer to something you can clone from there, I will provide <a href="https://github.com/soofka" target="_blank">convenient link</a>. As of now, you can find there only <a href="https://github.com/soofka/blog" target="_blank">source code of this blog</a>, parts of which will be described here in near future.</p>
    <p>That's it for now, I guess. I thought about doing this for a long time and I'm finally on the surface. See you soon.</p>
