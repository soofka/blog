<p>Hi! I am Jakub Sowi≈Ñski. I started writing down solutions to some of the problems that I confront during both my professional and private web development. These notes will be presented here in form of blog posts. I expect them to be major, if not the only category of content.</p>
<p>I have wide range of web development experience, from databases, through back-end, to front-end. In my current position I am full-stack web developer, but lately almost all of my tasks are focused on front-end, so I suppose that most of my posts for the next few months at least will be related to JavaScript, TypeScript and React. Sooner or later more variety of subjects will come.</p>
<p>Some code from my blog posts will be also available on GitHub. Whenever I will refer to something you can clone from there, I will provide <a href="https://github.com/soofka" target="_blank">convenient link</a>. As of now, you can find there only <a href="https://github.com/soofka/blog" target="_blank">source code of this blog</a>, parts of which will be described here in near future.</p>
<p>That's it for now, I guess. I thought about doing this for a long time and I'm finally on the surface. See you soon.</p>
