<p>During the lecture, I talked about <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist" target="_blank">Progressive Web App Checklist by Google</a> and how to fulfill certain points, focusing mainly on Service Workers, Push Notifications, and how to implement them, based on real scenarios. (Hence "case study" in the title. In other words, it's one of those "a lot of code on the screen" lectures.)</p>
<p>Admittedly, it was a worse performance than <a href="http://soofka.pl/entry/i-gave-a-lecture-on-code-europe-spring-2017" target="_blank">my previous attempt</a>, or at least I felt less prepared and in worse shape. I am glad for this experience, it gave me a few important lessons, one of them resulting in my decision that next lecture I will give, I will give only because I want to share something cool with people, not because I want to give a lecture. I want them to be inspiring, and for it to happen, I need to feel that way.</p>
<p>Again, slides are available <a href="http://soofka.pl/files/progressive_web_apps_case_study.pptx" target="_blank">here</a>. If you have any question or feedback for me or for those slides, please, do not hesitate to contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/pansoofka" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>PS This time I got proper badge! :-)</p>
