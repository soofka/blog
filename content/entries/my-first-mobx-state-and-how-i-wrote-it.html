<p>So far, for a few years already, whenever I wanted my application to have some global state, I've used <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank">Redux</a>. It's reliable, it works, and it's quite easy to implement, although, admittedly, it's not that easy to learn. In order to get a grasp of it, one has to understand non-trivial implementation of flow of data through store, actions, and reducers. It easily can get really confusing at the beginning.</p>
<p>Another thing I've noticed about Redux is that it's often used wrongly. It's easy to use it in a wrong way - more often than not it still works - but using it properly, by the book, requires at least shallow understanding of underlying theoretical concepts, and, more importantly, applying them to one's code, which sometimes can be tricky, might require some refactoring, and usually ends up somewhere around the end of technical debt list.</p>
<p>Lately, huge rise in popularity of another state management library, <a href="https://mobx.js.org">MobX</a>, can be observed. I see it being adapted in more and more projects and getting more and more community support. Therefore, I wanted to try it out myself. My first impression on it was that it must be simpler, more straight forward version of Redux - it's described by it's authors as "simple, scalable state management" after all. Given the nature of my project - this blog, which is really far from being complex application - I figured, that the simplest solution will be the best (and that it's also great opportunity to taste it).</p>
