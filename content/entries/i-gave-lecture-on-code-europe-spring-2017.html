<p>Apparently, my reception wasn’t that bad after all, since I was invited to give another lecture on this conference’s next edition, which will take place on Polish National Stadium in Warsaw on 7th of December. (I start panicking already.)</p>
<p>Slides, that I used to help me to get my point through, can be downloaded from <a href="https://soofka.pl/files/practial_tips_for_optimizing_javasciprt.pptx" target="_blank">here</a>. In case of any other questions or suggestions related to what I was talking about when standing on that stage (or any other, really), feel free to contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/pansoofka" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>PS On the photo is my badge from that event. Yes, they didn't have the one with "SPEAKER" label prepared for me :-(</p>
