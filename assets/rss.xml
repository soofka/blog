            <description><![CDATA[Who doesn't like to constantly rework perfectly fine stuff into something new and fancy just because it's trendy now? Well, probably pretty much every single JS developer, most certainly everyone who works with this language long enough to experience at least a glimpse of famous "JS fatigue" feeling (so approximately a few weeks). However, I created this blog as a playground to try out new libraries and frameworks, and since I'm learning Styled Components for my professional work at the moment, even though Sass-based styling worked perfectly for my needs, I reimplemented all of it into this controversial CSS-in-JS. And I'm still sane!]]></description>

Nowadays, in my professional work, majority, if not all of front-end applications I am working on are connected to multiple back-end services for variety of reasons. It gives me a freedom of not caring of the back-end, as long as we have defined a contract, and proceeding happily with what actually matters, i.e. colors and animations. But it also gave ma some headache, when I wanted to have pleasant, convenient coding environment on my localhost, and not have all of these weird back-end stuff running on my local machine as well.

The city, although horribly crowded by tourists at all places, at all times (at least that's what it feels like), made me fell in love with it in only one weekend. I wouldn't have an opportunity for this magnificent experience, if it wasn't for React Europe - a conference, that took place in Paris on 17th and 18th of May, that was my primary goal of the trip. And, similarly to the city itself, the conference exceeded my expectations on many levels. Let me tell you how.]]></description>

Sometimes you'll manage to complete your assignment just fine with some predefined boilerplate, without too much need for deep investigation of it's nooks and crannies. Other times, you'll end up in a position, where you reverse engineer it in order to introduce some major change, or just give up and start from scratch with your own thing. I wouldn't like you to give up on my application skeleton. Thus, I'll describe some of it's shenanigans in it's documentation. Today, I'm explaining build process.]]></description>
