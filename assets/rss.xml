            <description><![CDATA[<p>At least every 6 months, I browse web to find interesting, upcoming IT conferences around the world and see if they fit my interests, budget, and calendar. Lately I'm focused particularly on front-end of web development. In this world, there are tons of events every weekend, on every, even tiniest and most specific subject. I find it challenging, to browse through hundreds of agendas, looking for accumulations of talks that seem to be time-worthy, so as I do my research, I try to share results as well. Here are they so far.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the challenges that I faced while programming this, so far, very simple blog app (the one that you are using to read this post, most likely), was how to give my readers a possibility to comment on my posts. Obviously, it is one of the crucial features of this kind of app – I would like my readers to be able to tell me where am I wrong, and I would like me to be able to respond to such heretic claims. However, the whole feature seems quite a lot of work to implement from scratch. Luckily, there are plenty of ready out of the box solutions out there, one of them being <a href="https://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a>.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>I am web developer. My job is to solve problems, usually related to software architecture or specific details of software implementation. During that process, I often find myself browsing the Internet, looking for people who had similar problems, solved them and described their solution. This kind of content is generally found either on internet forums or professional blogs. Since these sources provided me with, often very comprehensive, answers on countless occasions, I thought that the best way to appreciate their effort to share their knowledge would be to contribute to this knowledge base myself.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I've visited Paris for the first time in my life. The city, although horribly crowded by tourists at all places, at all times (at least that's what it feels like), made me fell in love with it in only one weekend. I wouldn't have an opportunity for this magnificent experience, if it wasn't for <a href="https://www.react-europe.org" target="_blank">React-Europe</a> - a conference, that took place in Paris on 17th and 18th of May, that was my primary goal of the trip. And, similarly to the city itself, the conference exceeded my expectations on many levels. Let me tell you how.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most common issues I heard people have with my blog was lack of syntax highlighting in posts, especially those, which contain a lot of code. Okay, it's almost 2019, I'm software engineer, working mostly with front-end these times - I finally agreed, that it should be added. So I added it. And in the meantime, I also learned a little bit about Web Workers. Hence, this post, in which I describe this little adventure.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Using a skeleton for your application prepared by someone else comes with great benefit of a lot of time saved, but also with huge cost of a lot of knowledge not obtained. Sometimes you'll manage to complete your assignment just fine with some predefined boilerplate, without too much need for deep investigation of it's nooks and crannies. Other times, you'll end up in a position, where you reverse engineer it in order to introduce some major change, or just give up and start from scratch with your own thing. I wouldn't like you to give up on my application skeleton. Thus, I'll describe some of it's shenanigans in it's documentation. Today, I'm explaining build process.</p>]]></description>
