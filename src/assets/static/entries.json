Lately I'm focused particularly on front-end of web development. In this world, there are tons of events every weekend, on every, even tiniest and most specific subject. I find it challenging, to browse through hundreds of agendas, looking for accumulations of talks that seem to be time-worthy, so as I do my research, I try to share results as well. Here are they so far.",

The city, although horribly crowded by tourists at all places, at all times (at least that's what it feels like), made me fell in love with it in only one weekend. I wouldn't have an opportunity for this magnificent experience, if it wasn't for React Europe - a conference, that took place in Paris on 17th and 18th of May, that was my primary goal of the trip. And, similarly to the city itself, the conference exceeded my expectations on many levels. Let me tell you how.",

Sometimes you'll manage to complete your assignment just fine with some predefined boilerplate, without too much need for deep investigation of it's nooks and crannies. Other times, you'll end up in a position, where you reverse engineer it in order to introduce some major change, or just give up and start from scratch with your own thing. I wouldn't like you to give up on my application skeleton. Thus, I'll describe some of it's shenanigans in it's documentation. Today, I'm explaining build process.",

However, I had some tough moments with both of them when it came up to setting all unrecognized routing to \"Not Found\" page, and this piece came as a result of them.",
