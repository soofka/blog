<p>First big disappointment came with arrival to the venue. I honestly thought that I made a mistake with the address, that it is actually somewhere else. I checked the invitation once again and ensured that it is, in fact, the right place, even though I couldn’t find a single information about this event anywhere around the EXPO XXI center. Only after entering the building and asking for directions, I’ve noticed signs with directional arrows, printed on A4 sheets of paper, hanging on the wall near the entrance to some specific, minor area of the venue. My big hype was gone in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Even after realizing that it is not such a “wow” event that I expected, and after lowering my expectations, I was not satisfied with how the conference was organized. Small amount of space wasn’t really enough, given how many people showed up; there were two rooms, next to each other, with lectures being given simultaneously, and you could hear the other lecture from whatever room you’ve been in quite well, which was super disturbing, noticeably for speakers; catering, without going too much into the details, really just sucked.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I realize, that it was the first attempt to get this conference going and I’m sure the whole thing will be improved greatly for the next time. However, I met there a lot of people from abroad, who traveled to Warsaw exclusively for this event, baited by all the hype generated online, and I just felt bad for them. My level of disappointment must have been not that much, compared to theirs.</p>
<p>But enough with grumbling! I didn’t come there to eat sophisticated food or chill comfortably (although it would be nice to have those things). I came there to listen to some great and inspiring content, and some of it was like that indeed. Obviously, I didn’t attend all the lectures, although I was there with my colleagues from my company, so we tried to put at least one of us in each room for each session, and share knowledge and impressions afterwards.</p>

<p>From my personal experience, my favorite talk was “GraphQL vs REST” by Christoffer Noring. Its content was interesting and new for me, at least to some extent, but what really sold me on this topic was Christoffer’s great ability to be a speaker and lecturer. Even though originally GraphQL wasn’t really what I was there for, I felt the most engaged in his talk of all that I attended during this event, and it was fully caused by him being professional, prepared, and comfortable on stage and in front of the crowd.</p>
<p>I suppose I wouldn’t praise him so much for his speaking and presenting skills, if he didn’t stand out so much from majority of other speakers. Many of them seemed to have not that good time, having to speak loudly and clearly, when all eyes were on them; many of them struggled. After some lectures, I left the room with the feeling that the speaker wasn’t really prepared. This feeling was fueled additionally by the fact, that they often ended, according to the agenda, 10 or 15 minutes before time, despite plenty of questions from the audience after the actual talk.</p>
<p>Other lecture, that I enjoyed a lot, was “How to Fight and Prevent Burnout” by Alicia Sedlock. I didn’t expect topics of this kind on conference that was supposed to be focused on front-end web development, and most likely that’s why I decided to attend it. I wasn’t disappointed – neither by speaker’s skills related to presenting and lecturing, nor by the content of the talk, which was more than interesting.</p>

<p>Besides that, I heard great impressions from Lea Verou’s talk about CSS variables, and from Ruth John’s talk about audio visualization in browser, which I sadly didn’t manage to attend. There were a few other quite interesting subjects for talks, but they were poorly or dully presented, and I couldn’t help getting bad impressions. Other than that, I left the rooms mostly not excited at all about what I just heard.</p>
<p>So, it seems that I said, “enough with grumbling!” a few paragraphs earlier, and then I just kept grumbling… But it wasn’t that bad at all. After all, I met a lot of cool people, who I shared experiences and opinions with; I had a chance to talk to some lecturers, who gave me much more insights on the topic than when they were on stage; and I attended plenty of lectures, majority of which enriched my knowledge about front-end web development or just working in this kind of an environment in general.</p>
<p>To finish this short summary, I must say, that most probably I would like to attend next edition of this event, if it happens, and I recommend it to you as well, especially, if you are not that much experienced in front-end. The event didn’t meet my (honestly, really high) expectations, but still I would like to give it another chance, not only to see if organization has been improved, but to get this extra bit of knowledge from a lecture, that I probably will not expect to give it to me at all.</p>
