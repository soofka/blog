<p>In this note, I share my impressions on most of the talks I've attended during <a href="https://www.react-europe.org/" target="_blank">React Europe 2018</a>, based on notes I've taken when I was there, listening to these guys. It doesn't include all the talks from this event, simply because I've not attended all of them, or I've not found all of those, which I attended, interesting enough. React Europe published all the talks on their YouTube channel already, so if you're looking full coverage of the event, this would be the best place: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOWIJ4Mgb2k&list=PLCC436JpVnK3xH_ArpIjdkYDGwWNkVa73" target="_blank">day 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYWVGQKnz5M&list=PLCC436JpVnK1X7atG6EIz467Evs4TMX_5" target="_blank">day 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1ZLrdTHkNY&list=PLCC436JpVnK1blGoSX8rH55pdF05TfWJn" target="_blank">lightning talks</a>.</p>
<p>I will also not discuss my general impression of the event, as I did in case of <a href="/entry/frontend-con-2017-summary" target="_blank">FrontEnd-Con 2017</a>. For this purpose, I'll prepare a separate entry. This one is meant to be a summary of the talks, with links to video recordings of the lectures, slides, some materials, and my thoughts about each particular piece of content. Perhaps, if you've not been there, you'll get a grasp of it, feel a little bit inspired, as I did during those talks; on the other hand, if you've been there, maybe you'll find my opinion different than yours, and you'll share your feeling and reflection.</p>
<h3>Keynote - Ken Wheeler</h3>

<p>I don't think it was decided by chance, that the first talk of the first day of the conference was performed by Ken Wheeler. He talked about new features in React, some just shipped, some to be ready to use in next weeks: new lifecycle methods, introduced for increased safety of asynchronous operations; context API, which allows one to teleport data across the tree; suspense API, to be used for suspending rendering, to prevent eagerly showing loading UI. Ken, with his passion, great ability to tell a story, and a bunch of cool features to stimulate my imagination, did a great job, hyping me up for upcoming two days of React grind.</p>

<p>One particular thing, that I've noted during this talk, was diagram representation of difference between React synchronous and asynchronous rendering. In asynchronous way, which is meant to be introduced to React in near future, according to <a href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html" target="_blank">React dev blog</a>, an application has much more free time to respond to browser events, which results in smoother, more controlled user experience.</p>
<h3>The Case for Whimsy - Joshua Comeau</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau" target="_blank">@JoshWComeau</a>, <a href="https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-europe-talk-2018#the-case-for-whimsy" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2d9rw9RwyE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>In my professional work, most of the time I create things, that are specifically designed to be as not whimsical as possible. Common perception is that it's rather disturbing for people who use given software with a purpose, not just to play with it. In his talk, Joshua convinced me, that Internet could, and should, be more fun, lively, animated place, and that all those fancy elements and animations could not only be appealing and amusing, but actually serve a purpose, communicate some message to a user.</p>
<p>One, great example of this idea, that got stuck in my head, is e-mail client, in which simple animation tells user if he's currently creating a new message or replying to one, and if his message was sent, or saved as draft. This demo application was also published by Joshua and is now <a href="https://whimsical-mail-client.surge.sh/" target="_blank">available online</a>. It utilizes a concept of "meaningful motion with action driven animation" - the term that UX designers and front-end engineers might hear more and more in the next years. <a href="https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/meaningful-motion-w-action-driven-animation/" target="_blank">Here</a>, Tobias Ahlin discussed this subject in more details, and with examples.</p>
<h3>A Journey Through React Apollo - Peggy Rayzis</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/peggyrayzis" target="_blank">@peggyrayzis</a>, <a href="https://react-europe-apollo.surge.sh" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fCXYA3lZTbo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I've got plenty of notes from this lecture, even though I wasn't really planning to attend it in the first place; Peggy showed admirable skills as a speaker, she grabbed my attention, so I went on this journey with her. I put this lecture here, because I think it's a great way to get familiar with <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo" target="_blank">React Apollo</a> - I had no clue about it beforehand, and I understood what's the subject in first five minutes, thanks to the structure of this talk; it included brief answers to "what is this" and "why does it exist" questions at the beginning (kudos).</p>
<p>My conclusion from this talk: if you want to use GraphQL in React, you want to use React Apollo as well. It vastly simplifies all the effort of implementation, makes some complex connections with back-end much simpler to reason about, build, modify, and maintain. It is also up to date with newest advancements in React - it's already supporting Suspense API, as shown on the demo.</p>
<h3>Replicated Redux - Jim Purbrick</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/JimPurbrick" target="_blank">@JimPurbrick</a>, <a href="https://jimpurbrick.com/2018/05/22/replicated-redux-movie/" target="_blank">blog post</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fr3vp0C22H0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Jim tackled a problem, which kept my mind busy a few months ago: consistency of UI and application state in asynchronous or shared systems. I thought about it in the context of user going offline while using my application, how can I store and replay his actions, and what to do with those, that were unavailable at the time they were taken, but seemed to be available due to his lack of connection. Jim took the problem at least a few steps further, posing a question based on example of real time, PvP game of pairs made in React VR, where any UI mistake happening due to delay in updating application state could potentially spoil the game.</p>
<p>It was a trip through the world of Redux, enhanced with Jim's ideas for solutions for application state consistency. He also took much deeper dive into this area in a series of <a href="https://jimpurbrick.com/2018/05/22/replicated-redux-movie/" target="_blank">blog posts</a>. In general, I think the lecture and his blog are both valuable, comprehensive learning resources on this subject. Oh, and there's also <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-360/tree/master/Examples/Pairs" target="_blank">an example of full implementation of his solution</a>, ready to be improved and expanded further.</p>
<h3>Bridging React Native Back to its Roots - Vincent Riemer</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/vincentriemer" target="_blank">@vincentriemer</a>, <a href="https://rndom-slides.vincentriemer.app/" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aOWIJ4Mgb2k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This talk started out slowly, but ended up being, to me, the biggest announcement of this event. Vincent told about his experience with <a href="https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web">React Native Web</a> - a library, that brings <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> components and APIs to the web, effectively enabling writing code once, for both platforms. Despite the praise he gave to this lib, he pointed out that it's "web first", which results in plenty of other issues, and posed a question: what if it was "native first"? And then he proceeded to the answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vincentriemer/react-native-dom" target="_blank">React Native DOM</a> is Vincent's "experimental, comprehensive port of React Native to the web", and it was officially released during this talk. It addresses the same problems React Native Web does, but in another way. And it comes with some cool features. It follows React Native architecture, therefore leaving main thread to focus on rendering, and moving everything else to be processed by some side thread - a web worker. There's also one bundler for all platforms - Metro Bundler - and promise of more layout consistency across platforms, due to custom bindings to Yoga and compilation to WebAssembly.</p>
<p>This promise can be easily tested, as Vincent, during his talk, gave plenty examples of applications he ported to this technology already; even slides are one of them. However, he also warned us - and this is clearly stated in README of his project as well - it's very early version, it's still not production ready, it still needs to be refined ("1. make it work, 2. make it right, 3. make it fast" - he just made it work). Nevertheless, he received big round of applause, and a few contributors joined his project since then. I expect, or maybe rather I hope, it to grow big in near future.</p>
<h3>Do the Right (to Left) Thing: Directional Content in React - Maja Wichrowska</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/majapw" target="_blank">@majapw</a>, <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/MajaWichrowska/do-the-right-to-left-thing/secret/mkUlR8s1sCcFo" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZ9vQYSNVyo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I liked Maja's talk already after a few slides, simply because she showed me an issue, which I've never realized before. Clearly, I've never worked on a software interface, that is meant to display any other alphabet than latin, so I became super interested in this right on the spot.</p>
<p>Arabic language is one of those, which are different enough from latin to cause a problem, mainly because it's written from right to left. For Arabic version of AirBnB, they wanted to switch whole layout from left to right to right to left, which includes not only moving menu from one side to another, but all the little things, such as placement of icons and direction of arrows on buttons. Turns out, there are plenty of simple solutions, ready to be used out of the box, such as <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/react-with-direction" target="_blank">react-with-direction</a> library, which provides higher order component to wrap around your components and display stuff conditionally, based on direction of the text. It can even be applied to user-generated text (which might be in any language and should be displayed accordingly), where it will recognize the direction based on content, and pass it as a prop to your component.</p>
<p>However, for AirBnB the issue at that point was far from resolved, due to complex nature of their software. Hence, Maja presented sophisticated stack of tools and libraries, which allows them to create stylesheets dynamically in both compile time and run time, and address very specific scenarios, their users might stumble upon (TL;DW they use CSS-in-JS).</p>
<h3>Up and Running with Universal Components - Samantha Bretous & Kurtis Kemple</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/SamanthaBretous" target="_blank">@SamanthaBretous</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/KurtisKemple" target="_blank">@KurtisKemple</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eOEeYXUWEfHyuhr57AJtlS7qTdm_upVnZeDsYnxVvqQ/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1NkyO-J6B0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This was cool and lively talk about creating universal components in complex environments, such as big project, or big company, or - most likely - both. It really covered whole basics of the topic: what is universal component, why create one, why don't create one, and how to create one: how to implement, how to maintain, how to document, how to communicate, how to sell it to the business, and some others.</p>
<p>It wasn't anything revolutionary or mindblowing, but it was really solid, straightforward, and complete. I am actually going to spread this lecture among front-end developers in my company, in order to ensure that we're on the same page, when it comes to understanding of what and why we're doing.</p>
<h3>A year of CodeSandbox - Ives van Hoorne</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/CompuIves" target="_blank">@CompuIves</a>, <a href="https://slides.com/ivesvanhoorne/react-europe" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qURPenhndYA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Ives gave very candid and inspiring talk about his experience with open source community. He became interested in it 2 years prior to this talk, on React Europe 2016, which was the first IT conference he attended. Immediately after he came back, he started his contribution, creating and publishing on Github. Eventually, he came up with an idea of <a href="https://codesandbox.io/" target="_blank">CodeSanbox</a>, which originally was very modest, and nowadays is absolutely mindblowing, online code editor.</p>
<p>What I personally found interesting in this talk, besides inspiration to contribute more to this wonderful world of open source, were Ives words, to release such project fast, and to let it evolve over time. I might be tired and not feel great about it, but potential audience may unexpectedly change my mind, as in Ives case.</p>
<h3>Redux without boilerplate - Jan-Jan Van Der Vyver</h3>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g-5H45CAPyQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This was one of the lightning talks, which took place in between regular ones. Each speaker had about 5 minutes to present his idea. Jan showed one particular library, <a href="https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable">redux-observable</a>, and I found it interesting, especially for my professional work. Using this tool, one can compose bunch of actions into an epic, and simplify the way they are handled. Seems to be useful in case of complex systems, where there are plenty of asynchronous actions happening at all times.</p>
<h3>React in Battlefield 1 - Markus Thurlin</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/truppo" target="_blank">@truppo</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pkf9H3XEMoE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>This talk I included here only because I find it really cool, that Battlefield 1 client is built with Redux and MobX. I don't know why, but it always makes me feel good, seeing how technologies I am familiar with are being used for something so different from what I'm usually using them for. It's great to know, that you not only can do it in React, but you actually do it in React :-).</p>
<h3>React: smiling while you’re styling! - Bruce Lawson</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/brucel" target="_blank">@brucel</a>, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/brucel/mr-potato-bruce" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRhJZZsTEvQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Another ligtning talk, this time focused on styling components with <a href="https://stylable.io/" target="_blank">Stylable</a>. It's superset of CSS, created specifically for styling components in a way that they don't conflict with each other, and code remains reusable. Honestly, this talk took only 5 minutes, so I couldn't really get a grasp of the subject, but from what I've seen during the talk and in the documentation, it seems to be very comprehensive, and also very performant, as shown on the <a href="https://potatobruce.io/" target="_blank">example</a>.</p>
<h3>Immutable Application Architecture - Lee Byron</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/leeb" target="_blank">@leeb</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTcDmnAXZ4E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Before this talk, I thought that it's going to be about some certain specific of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/" target="_blank">Immutable</a> library. I thought it's going to be focused on some specific details. It was exactly the opposite. Lee started with very high level introduction of concept of architecture forged by Roman architect Vitruvius, nowadays known as Vitruvian Triad: a structure must exhibit three qualities - it must be solid, useful, and beautiful. According to Lee, the same is true for software.</p>
<p>Lee challenged good old MVC architecture and proposed new solution for software design, Immutable Declarative Expandable Architecture - IDEA. It consists of a few entities more than the classic, but seems to describe much more accurately, what is happening in behind the hood of modern web applications.</p>

<p>Picture above is my biggest takeaway from this lecture. I find it really useful to have solid, clear graphical representation of the architecture, that is effectively the architecture I'm designing and implementing on a daily basis. Now it finally has a name and a diagram, so I can reason about it much more conveniently.</p>
<h3>WebAssembly becoming the biggest platform - Sven Sauleau</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/svensauleau" target="_blank">@svensauleau</a>, <a href="http://reacteu-2018.ralf.cc/" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
<p>Strangely enough, there is no video recording from this lecture online. But it happened. You have to believe me.</p>
<p>WebAssembly is a web standard that defines a binary format and a corresponding assembly-like text format for executable code in Web pages. It is meant to enable executing code nearly as fast as running native machine code. I see it being discussed on the web and on IT conferences more and more over last years, and this talk felt very similar to all previous ones. It's solid piece of knowledge for those, who are not familiar with the subject. One takeaway for me was, that even though there is no point in compiling JavaScript to WebAssembly, there are people working on <a href="https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript" target="_blank">AssemblyScript</a>, a compiler for TypeScript. Nice! I want to try it out soon.</p>
<h3>Beyond React - Devin Abbott</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/dvnabbott" target="_blank">@dvnabbott</a>, <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/lona" target="_blank">project on Github</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVwLOcllTfI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Devin came to React Europe with another approach to making code written in React universal, but he took it to whole another level. He introduced project <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/Lona" target="_blank">Lona</a>, which tackles this matter from three different angles: there's Lona Components, data format for universal components (.component); there's Lona Compiler, a CLI tool to generate UI components, transforming .component files into implementations in many different targets; and finally there's Lona Studio, a GUI tool, where you can literally select specific properties of the component from a dropdown menu.</p>
<img src="/images/lona-studio-preview.jpg" alt="Lona Studio">
<center><small>Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVwLOcllTfI" target="_blank">Beyond React - Devin Abbott aka @dvnabbott at @ReactEurope 2018 (youtube.com)</a></small></center>
<p>Lona is in early development stage and it was only officially announced on this conference. Demo presented by Devin during the talk was really impressive, especially when he showed Lona Studio, but on numerous occasions he emphasized, how early version it is. It's also highlighted very apparently in their documentation. Lona Studio is native Mac app, Lona Compiler can only target Swift, etc. Still, the announcement was welcomed by the crowd with a lot of appreciation.</p>
<h3>SVGR or how a simple problem became a 2K stars library - Greg Bergé</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/neoziro" target="_blank">@neoziro</a>, <a href="https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr" target="_blank">project on Github</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/geKCzi7ZPkA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I liked Greg's talk because of two things: I learned that <a href="https://github.com/smooth-code/svgr" target="_blank">SVGR</a> is a proper way of implementing SVG in React application (and it works with TypeScript too!); and I heard a few honest words on publishing a library in open source community and attempting to make it successful, with happy end. Good lesson for anyone planning to follow his footsteps.</p>
<h3>Type-safe React Native with ReasonML - Jared Forsyth</h3>
<h5><a href="https://twitter.com/jaredforsyth" target="_blank">@jaredforsyth</a>, <a href="https://jaredforsyth.com/type-safe-react-native/" target="_blank">slides</a></h5>
<div class="video-container"><div class="video-container--wrapper"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mXvgZpgRJ6Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>In the last talk of the conference, Jared tried to convince us to try out <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/" target="_blank">Reason</a>, which is a thin layer over OCaml - strongly typed, over 20-years old language. Reason provides out of the box type safety and immutability. It compiles to human readable JavaScript, but honestly, it doesn't look that different from it anyway. Plus, it provides an option for cross-platform compilation. At the same time, Reason has small community, thus it's not easy to find solution of your problem on StackOverflow, and library of packages is rather limited. It's also not the safest language that is out there, when it comes to type safety. I guess that human readable syntax comes with a cost.</p>
<p>In the end, I was actually convinced by Jared to try it out, but I still don't know how I want to put it to use. Nevertheless, I include this talk in my list, maybe someone reading this will get a better idea.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I am sorry that not every talk made it to my summary. I attended most of them, but not all of them (I missed out on most of lightning talks); from some I didn't take away that much, others I didn't understand or I understood them poorly. Well, to be honest, some of those, which I described, I still don't understand, but they intrigued me enough to do some research and learn more about them. Hopefully, I inspired you to get to know more too.</p>
<p>I will post my thoughts on the event itself in a few days, as a part 2 of summary of React Europe 2018.</p>
